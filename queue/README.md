# Queue

Basic queue implementation using array. However, queues can be implemented using linked-list which enables our queue to expand as needed and not have to allocate memory in initialization.

Queues follow basic premise: first in first out (FIFO), which makes queues very useful when processing tasks in the order they which arrived in.
